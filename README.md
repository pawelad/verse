Verse is a RESTful API that checks the latest version of your favourite open
source project and simplifies the whole process to one HTTP request. Just like
that.

It comes with a bunch of [available projects][verse available projects] - with
much more on the way - and also allows using any GitHub repository as a source
of released versions, as long as it uses tags and [standardized][pep440]
version names. And if it doesn't - feel free to [suggest][github add issue]
adding it and I'll be happy to help.

Last seen at [verse.pawelad.xyz][verse], with [docs][verse docs] and a
[browsable API][verse browsable api].

The project is still in its early days so all help is appreciated - suggestions
for new features and projects to add, bug reports, help with design, etc.
Oh, and don't worry - a _cool_ domain is also on the list of things to do.

Package source code is available at [GitHub][github].

Feel free to use, ask, fork, star, report bugs, fix them, suggest enhancements,

Also, take a look [here][verse running locally] if you want to run Verse
locally.

## Tests
Package was tested with the help of `py.test` and `tox` on Python 3.4, 3.5
and 3.6 with Django 1.10 and Django REST Framework 3.6 (see `tox.ini`).

Code coverage is available at [Coveralls][coveralls].

To run tests yourself you need to set environment variable with Django secret
key before running `tox` inside the repository:

```shell
$ export SECRET_KEY='...'
$ pip install tox
$ tox
```
